Example 1 — Non-compliant (>5%)
Input excerpt: “Rates may be adjusted annually by CPI, not to exceed six percent (6%).”
Expected JSON: "stated_cap_percent": 6.0, "compliance_status": "non_compliant", "reason": "Cap exceeds 5%", preferred redline as above (3.5% cap), fallback 4.0%.

Example 2 — Compliant (≤4%)
Input excerpt: “Annual adjustment equal to CPI-U, capped at three percent (3%).”
Expected JSON: "stated_cap_percent": 3.0, "compliance_status": "compliant", "reason": "Cap at 3% meets 3.5–4% target", no change required.

Example 3 — Tighten (≤5% but >4%)
Input excerpt: “Annual price increase shall be the lesser of CPI or five percent (5%).”
Expected JSON: "stated_cap_percent": 5.0, "compliance_status": "tighten", "reason": "Cap at 5%—tighten to 3.5–4%", provide 3.5% preferred redline and 4.0% fallback.

Example 4 — Missing Cap / Ambiguous
Input excerpt: “Prices are subject to supplier’s standard annual list update and inflation.”
Expected JSON: "stated_cap_percent": null, "compliance_status": "missing_cap", "reason": "Annual escalation with no ceiling", insert 3.5% cap language; add CPI-U reference; specify once per 12 months; non-compounded; prior notice.
